### Motivation


<p class="text-center">

In 2020, the world entered into a pandemic and now two years later as we recover and try to move on with life, everything is different. The pandemic brought with it a new lens that showed disparities based on SES, geographical location, etc. that always existed but were never taken seriously. 

Below are some articles that explore these ideas and have inspired our project:

* The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html) talks about how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the economic inequality gap that has always existed.
* [This article](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01582-4) by Khanijahani et al. (2021) highlights how people of color and those from a low SES are at higher risk to contracting COVID-19.as such, public health professionals should be aware of such gaps and make it an effort to especially focus on these groups at higher risk 
* Spacial analysis is an extremely impactful analysis technique in public health to address major issues, including COVID. [This spacial analysis study](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12267-6) done in Central Iran identified key districts that play a major role in the transmission of the virus and so will benefit greatly in interventions to prevent and control the spread. 


Our goal with this project was two fold: First we aimed to use the spacial analysis technique and apply it to understanding how COVID-19 is spatially auto-correlated across different counties in the State of New York. Second, we wanted to test whether health behaviors and socioeconomic (SES) factors are associated with COVID-19 changes in each county from 2020 to 2022.

###  Data

<p class="text-center">

To conduct our analysis, we considered four available data sources:

1. US Census Bureau: Demographics<br>
The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html) contains information on population and housing. We used demographics data from NY in our analysis.


2. University of Wisconsin, Population Health Institute: New York State Health Ranking <br>
We obtained the data from [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/new-york/data-and-resources) (CHR&R) program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This data allows us to explore the county health factor ranking in the State of New York. 


3. NY.gov: COVID-19 cases in New York from 2020-2022 <br>
The official website for the State of New York contains a publically available, COVID-19 information page [data on COVID-19 testing, cases, vaccinations, etc.](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-data-new-york) 


4. Health.ny.gov: Land Area for each New York State County <br>
This website contains [land area for each New York County](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2010/table02.htm) as of 2010 [data on New York County Land

###  Research questions

1) How to gain a better understanding of the change in COVID-19 incidence and risk for each county in New York State?
2) Which modifiable health factors (i.e., quality of clinical care, healthy behaviors, etc.) are also risk factors of COVID-19?
3) What social determinants of health variables are also associated with higher risk of COVID-19 infection and fatality?

### Main results

The linear regression test showed that health behaviors (combination of tobacco use, diet & exercise, alcohol & drug use, and sexual activity) are significantly and positively correlated with COVID risk. Higher health behaviors ranking is associated with lower COVID risk: lower number of cases and fatalities but higher rate of vaccination. Among the sub-factors of health behaviors, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity were statistically significant. Furthermore, generalized linear regression and linear regression tests indicated that higher number of COVID fatalities and lower rate of COVID vaccination can be seen in counties with higher percentage of minorities (Black and Hispanic), lower median income, and high segregation score (Black vs. Non-White). Lastly, we were able to build predictive for estimating the number of COVID cases in New York City in the short term. 

### Discussions

The health behaviors that were found to be significantly associated with COVID risk are also known to be drivers of health disparities. In part, such disparities exist as a result of deep-rooted residential segregation. High-minority, lower-income neighborhoods are often found to have more fast food restaurants, smoke shops, and liquor shops while having less number of gyms and grocery markets with healthy, fresh produce. Therefore, it would be interesting the test how the association varies when interaction terms are included in our models. Since temperature and population density have been shown to influence COVID transmission, further testing on how COVID cases vary after adjusting for distance to NYC (epicenter of the COVID outbreak in NYS) and temperature (temperature in Northern counties of NYS are lower than that of others) could provide further information. Lastly, the Shiny app is a powerful tool for visualizing variations in COVID incidence and risk for each county in NY State. Therefore, to minimize COVID impact in high-minority, low SES neighborhoods, public health officials should design community-based programs that incorporate information from the Shiny app.
