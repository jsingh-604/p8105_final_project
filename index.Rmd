### Motivation


<p class="text-center">

In 2020, the world entered into a pandemic and now two years later as we recover and try to move on with life, everything is different. The pandemic brought with it a new lens that showed disparities based on SES, geographical location, etc. that always existed but were never taken seriously. 

Below are some articles that explore these ideas and have inspired our project:

* The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/coronavirus-inequality.html) talks about how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the economic inequality gap that has always existed.
* [This article](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01582-4) by Khanijahani et al. (2021) highlights how people of color and those from a low SES are at higher risk to contracting COVID-19.as such, public health professionals should be aware of such gaps and make it an effort to especially focus on these groups at higher risk 
* Spacial analysis is an extremely impactful analysis technique in public health to address major issues, including COVID. [This spacial analysis study](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12267-6) done in Central Iran identified key districts that play a major role in the transmission of the virus and so will benefit greatly in interventions to prevent and control the spread. 


Our goal with this project was two fold: First we aimed to use the spacial analysis technique and apply it to understanding how COVID-19 is spatially auto-correlated across different counties in the State of New York. Second, we wanted to test whether health behaviors and socioeconomic (SES) factors are associated with COVID-19 changes in each county from 2020 to 2022.

###  Data

<p class="text-center">

To conduct our analysis, we considered three publically available data sources:

1. US Census Bureau: Demographics<br>
The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html) contains information gather population and housing information from all residents in the country every 10 years. We used demographic data from NY in our analysis.


2. University of Wisconsin, Population Health Institute: New York State Health Ranking <br>
We obtained data from the [County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/new-york/data-and-resources) (CHR&R) program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. This data allows us to explore the county rankings in the State based on sub-factors of health as well as health measures as variables of interest for analysis. 


3. NY.gov: COVID-19 cases in New York from 2020-2022 <br>
The official website for the State of New York contains a COVID-19 information page which also includes publically available [data on COVID-19 testing, cases, vaccinations, etc.](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-data-new-york) We chose datasets that includes information on COVID-19 test, cases, and vaccinations that by county to be able to explore the distributions of these variables across NY counties.

###  Research questions






### Main results

Ashwini's results:

* Smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are all associated with receiving at least the first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine.  
* After adjusting for median age, unemployment is associated with receiving at least the first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine.


### Discussion


Ashwini's analysis addition to discussion:

The estimates generated from the models are not accurate because we have established that COVID-19 outcomes (cases, deaths, and first dose of vaccine) must be geospacially considered. Since our data is based on the county level and not individual level, it is hard to adjust geographically in a model, which is why we have a separate geospacial analysis. Regardless, the models showed that the predictors smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and unemployment are all associated with having received the first dose of a COVID vaccine. Using this information, public health professional can target resources and interventions to people who fit these predictors.
