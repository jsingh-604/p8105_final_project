The coefficients for an ARIMA (8,0,0) model represent the weights that are applied to the past 8 values of the time series (i.e. $y_{t-1}$, $y_{t-2}$, $y_{t-3}$, $y_{t-4}$, $y_{t-5}$, $y_{t-6}$, $y_{t-7}$, $y_{t-8}$) in order to predict the next value of the time series ($\hat{y}_t$). In this case, the coefficients are as follows:

These coefficients can be used to write the ARIMA (8,0,0) equation as follows:

$\hat{y}t = \alpha_1 y{t-1} + \alpha_2 y_{t-2} + \alpha_3 y_{t-3} + \alpha_4 y_{t-4} + \alpha_5 y_{t-5} + \alpha_6 y_{t-6} + \alpha_7 y_{t-7} + \alpha_8 y_{t-8} + \beta_0$

$\begin{aligned} \hat{y}t &= 1.0562 \cdot y_{t-1} - 0.2312 \cdot y_{t-2} + 0.0948 \cdot y_{t-3} + 0.0779 \cdot y_{t-4} - 0.1035 \cdot y_{t-5} + 0.1343 \cdot y_{t-6} + 0.3918 \cdot y_{t-7} - 0.4517 \cdot y_{t-8} + 2924.354 \end{aligned}$

This equation can be used to predict the next value of the time series, $\hat{y}_t$, based on the past 8 values of the time series. The coefficients in the equation represent the relative importance of each of the past values in predicting the next value.
